# This project implements a complete CI/CD pipeline using jenkins to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying an application. 

the pipeline is integrated with github, so everytime new code is pushed to the repository, jenkins automatically trigers the pipeline. The pipeline consists of multiple stages like build, test, and deploy, ensuring continuous integration and continuous delivery of the application . Jenkins installed and configured (locally/ cloud instance).
